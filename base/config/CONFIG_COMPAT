# Note: 
# The EPICS_HOST_ARCH solaris-<arch>-gnu is new for base release R3.14
# so existing R3.13 applications, when HOST_ARCH is set to solaris and
# when built with R3.14, will look for base solaris-<arch> directories
# and not solaris-<arch>-gnu. If you plan to build R3.13 applications 
# against a solaris-<arch>-gnu built R3.14 base, you should set
# ANSI=GCC and CPLUSPLUS=G++ in base/config/CONFIG_SITE.Host.solaris
# and change ARCH_solaris=solaris-<arch> to ARCH_solaris=solaris-<arch>-gnu
# in base/config/CONFIG_COMPAT.
